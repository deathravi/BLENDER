This project creates a small 3D scene of a wooden table with a donut and a glass placed on top. It demonstrates basic modeling using primitive meshes (plane, torus, cylinder) and the use of different materials (wood, glass, icing). The scene highlights texturing and lighting to make the objects look realistic.
